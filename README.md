# Concerts-ticket-booking-system
The "Concerts ticket booking system" is a sophisticated website that aims to transform
the ticket reservation process.
This project outlines the development of a concert booking website that provides users with a straightforward and efficient platform for browsing, booking, and purchasing tickets for upcoming events. 
The website features a comprehensive interface including a homepage, user authentication (login and registration), an events page listing available concerts, a ticket booking page, and a payment confirmation page.
Developed using Python with Flask for the backend and MySQL for database management, HTML and CSS for frontend, the system ensures secure handling of user data and real-time updates of ticket availability.
